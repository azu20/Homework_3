## Challenges: 

This assignment was the most challenging yet. The first portion of the assignment was challenging but I was able to complete within a few hours. The second part of the assignment, creating a function to generate a password, I had the hardest time.  I reached out to my brothers, and am so gratefule they were able to tutor me, it took more than 6 hours of tutoring to be able to figure out the second half.  I know there is some opportunity to refactor my code, but breaking the steps down via code, helped me better understand how to acheive the end result. I look forward in reading your feedback. :-)
